# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to get an introduction to information technology concepts. Github, a common version control tool for programmers, is explored as a publishing medium for us to update readme files in the markdown syntax. We also get to explore IT concepts such as the differences between hardware and software, and the distinction between the people and processes involved. The commits to this repository will represent the progression for the assignment.
