# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to get an introduction to information technology concepts. Github, a common version control tool for programmers, is explored as a publishing medium for us to update readme files in the markdown syntax. We also get to explore IT concepts such as the differences between hardware and software, and the distinction between the people and processes involved. The commits to this repository will represent the progression for the assignment. 

# Information System Components

For this example, we will use an online shopping cart. 
## Hardware
The hardware in the example of an ecommerce service would be a computer that runs the website. 

## Software
The software in the example of an ecommerce service would be the program that builds and creates the website.

## Data
The data in the example of an ecommerce servce would be a users shopping cart, because it is a recorded record.

## People

The people in the example of an ecommerce service would be the user and the fullfillment workers who allow the order to go through.

## Processes

The process is the sales funnel of me ordering, the person processesing, and the mailperson shipping the product to my door.

# Github
## Client Server Architecture


## Cloud Computing

Github is considered cloud computing because it is delivering a service via the internet and can be used on any device that has a conncection to the internet.  An example would be Google's gmail or Google drive, you have the ability to access emails or files from any device that uses the internet.
